    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <h3>1. Configure Game</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In the settings (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i>), enter the price to claim each square. Then choose the percentage of the total buy-in that each winning square will win.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the main game board (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i>), tapping a team's name will allow you to change it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Claim Squares</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            On the main game board (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i>), players tap a square and enter their names to claim a square.
        </li>
        <li>
            The buy-in list (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-list"></i>) helps the game administrator can keep an eye on which players have paid.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Randomize Grid Scores</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Once all of the squares are claimed or you're ready to start, press the "Randomize Grid" button in the settings page (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></i>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> The only way to undo this is to reset the entire game.  This prevents the re-randomizing of the grid in order to create favorable score assignments.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Enter Team Scores</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            As each quarter ends, enter each team's <strong>TOTAL</strong> score on the main game board (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i>). This is a running total, not a box score.
        </li>
        <li>
            Example: Both teams have a score of 7 after the 1st Qtr. Enter 7 for both teams. During the 2nd Qtr, Team A scores another 3 pts making their total 10 pts and Team B scores another 7 pts making their
            total 14 pts. Enter 10 for Team A and 14 for Team B.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Win!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            On the main game board (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-th"></i>), the winning square for each quarter will be highlighted in its corresponding color.
        </li>
        <li>
            The winners list (<i class="glyphlet glyphicon glyphicon-usd"></i>) helps the game administrator calculate each winner's payout and which players have been paid their winnings.
        </li>
    </ul>
